# Team-Project-HTML-CSS
A Project developed in second year of college with me as the Team Leader. I created the Navigation tool that links and combines all of the websites.
Each part of the project is dedicated to different sections of the company Alphabet(parent company of Google).
In this project we utilise teamwork, HTML and CSS. During the process of dvelopment, no man/woman on our team was left behind and all contributed towards the final project and goal.
